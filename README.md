# Character Recognition of Handwritten Hiragana

#1. In order to run the program start NN via a Vs Code or a different application that can handle Notebooks (The Code needs to be altered then!)
#2. Run all
#3. Draw the desired sign into the canvas and press on top left "recognize" to start the process
#4. On right side three possible recognized signs will appear with their % chance underneath
#5. For a new input or to retry the process press "clear" on top left 

#Canvas.png is an example for how the drawing might look. font_file.ttf contains the japanese font, k49_classmap.csv contains mapping and should not be edited to avoid recognition error, NN.ipynb contains Neural Network as well as Application code, Data is saved in the data folder
